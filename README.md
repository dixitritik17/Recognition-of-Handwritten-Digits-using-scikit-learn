# Recognition-of-Handwritten-Digits-using-scikit-learn
This work delineates the Recognition of Handwritten Digits using scikit-learn. Handwritten digit recognition is the ability of a computer to recognize the human handwritten digits from different sources like images, papers, touch screens and classify them into 10 predefined classes (0–9). Digit recognition has many applications like number plate recognition, postal mail sorting, bank check processing, etc. This work has been performed in order to accept or reject the Hypothesis state below:

“The Digits data set of the scikit-learn library provides numerous data-sets that are useful for testing many problems of data analysis and prediction of the results. Some Scientist claims that it predicts the digit accurately 95% of the times.”

An estimator that is useful in this case is sklearn.svm.SVC, which uses the technique of Support Vector Classification (SVC).
